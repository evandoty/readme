## Evan Doty's Readme

Hi - I'm Evan. I'm a Senior Cloud Solution Architect in the Retail and Consumer Group, and my manager is Renan Mathias Fernandes. I've spent my entire career- over twenty years at this point - working with, around, and adjacent to Microsoft technologies, and in 2022 I took a deep breath and applied to work here. 

This page is intended to help others understand what it might be like to work with me, especially people who haven't worked with me before. It's also to share my ideas of how to work remotely effectively (many caged from [Darren Murph](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/ceo/chief-of-staff-team/readmes/dmurph/#darrens-readme) and others of his mindset), because I've found tremendous value in doing so over the last seven or eight years. This project was inspired in part by Darren Murph, and the GitLab team, and in part by the introductory powerpoint that Renan provided for the team.

Please feel free to contribute to this page by opening a merge request (I'm still learning github, so bear with me on that score.)

## About Me

* I'm originally from the West Coast - and when I say the 'West Coast' I mean all of it. I was born in Alaska, have lived in Central Washington State, Northern California, Eastern Washington State, and Southern California. The first time I was at a school for more than 2 years was College. Now I live just outside DC in one of the Northern Virginia suburbs with my wife 2 kids (3 and 5), and 2 big dogs. 

* I love road trips. My family has driven over 25,000 miles since June of 2020, and my kids have already been to 39 states. We figure we can do the entire lower 48 before my son starts Kindergarten next fall.
