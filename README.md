## Evan Doty's Readme

Hi - I'm Evan. I'm a Senior Cloud Solution Architect in the Retail and Consumer Group, and my manager is Renan Mathias Fernandes. I've spent my entire career- over twenty years at this point - working with, around, and adjacent to Microsoft technologies, and in 2022 I took a deep breath and applied to work here. 

This page is intended to help others understand what it might be like to work with me, especially people who haven't worked with me before. It's also to share my ideas of how to work remotely effectively (many caged from [Darren Murph](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/ceo/chief-of-staff-team/readmes/dmurph/#darrens-readme) and others of his mindset, because I've found tremendous value in doing so over the last seven or eight years.
